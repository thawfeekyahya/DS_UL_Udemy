### Strict Binary

A full binary tree, also known as a proper binary tree or a strictly binary tree, is a type of binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children. In other words, no node in a full binary tree has only one child. This property ensures that all internal nodes have exactly two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

### Complete Binary tree

A complete binary tree is a type of binary tree in which all levels, except possibly the last, are fully filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. This means that if a node exists at a particular level, all nodes to its left at the same level must also exist.

Here are some key characteristics of a complete binary tree:

* Full Levels: All levels except possibly the last one are completely filled with nodes.
* Leftmost Position: Nodes on the last level are filled from left to right without any gaps between them.
